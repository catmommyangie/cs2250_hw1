        <p><u>Beaches at Sunset</u></p>

        <br><del>I hate the ocean because it freaks me out and sand gets everywhere. But, I like sitting at the shore and watching the waves.</del><ins> Sunsets are soooo beautiful. You can see how the colors of the sun mix with the clouds.</ins>

        <p><u>Six Flags</u></p>

        <pre>This is me and my siblings at Six Flags. I always get a season pass. I go whenever I have the free time. I never go on the weekends because I hate places that are overcrowded.
My favorite rides are X2, Crazanity, Apocalypse, Twisted Colossus, and Full Throttle.<small>I like the feeling of hanging upside down. Defying gravity makes me feel so free.</small></pre>

        <p><u>Korea</u></p>
        <img src="./korea.jpg" alt="korea" width="200">
        <br><p>Korea is such a fun country to travel. Evertyhing is so cheap, aesthetically pleasing, fast paced, beautiful, and offer so many cool things to experience. When I boarded my return flight the post-Korea depression really hit hard. I hope to go back again soon!</p>

        <P><u>Tokyo Central/ Japanese Home Store</u></P>
        <img src="./tokyocentral.jpg" alt="tokyo central" width="400">
        <br><p>I love going to Japanese stores! They have such unique snacks and food to try out, cute figurines, cool cosmetic products, and many more. This is me taking a picture of the figurines I got at a Japanese store. No matter how many times I go, I never get bored!</p>

        <br><p>I love going to concerts. Listening to a live concert hits so much differently than listening through headphones. I went to a lot of concerts. I went to concerts for Emotional Oranges, La Primavera Sound, Keshi, Feng Suave, <abbr>CAS</abbr>(Cigarettes After Sex), Kcon, Cafune, Benee, and many more! The concert I enjoyed the most is Kcon because I get to see many artists in one day. Also, their songs are so fun so it makes the experience even better and livelier!Heres a video of Girl in Red when they performed at La Primavera Sound. I was so shocked at how good their performance was!</p>
